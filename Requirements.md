**Secondary Core Objective: AI â€“ Powered Query**

*Implement this after the core objectives.*

Integrate an LLM (OpenAI API) to allow users to query invoice and client data using natural language. A floating chat icon on the corner of the webpage would be good, if viable.

**Sample queries it should handle:**
* Given the purchase history of my clients, suggest who is most likely to buy \<Product/Service X\>  
* For each customer, based on their purchase history, suggest one or more products I can likely cross-sell or up-sell to them  
* Which clients show signs of churn risk based on declining invoice volume or delayed payments?  
* Identify clients whose buying patterns have changed significantly in the last 3 months.
