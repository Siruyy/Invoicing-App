# Invoicing Application

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** .NET 7 (C#), ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (LLM-powered queries)
- **Email:** SendGrid


## Project Setup Instructions (How to Run It)

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (install globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- Supabase PostgreSQL (see setup instructions below)

### Supabase PostgreSQL Setup
1. Create a free project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2. In your Supabase project, go to the "Connect" and select the "Session pooler" connection, then copy the connection string.
3. Update the `DefaultConnection` value in `Backend/src/InvoicingApp.Api/appsettings.Development.json` with your Supabase connection string.

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to `Backend/src/InvoicingApp.Api`.
2. Restore dependencies:
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```
3. Apply migrations (if needed):
   ```sh
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
4. Add your API keys in `Backend/src/InvoicingApp.Api/appsettings.Development.json` as needed (e.g., SendGrid, OpenAI, etc.).
5. Run the API:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API will start on the port specified in `launchSettings.json` (default: 5000 or 5001).

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to `Frontend/invoicing-frontend`.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Angular app:
   ```sh
   ng serve
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Features Completed and Not Completed

### Core Objectives (Completed)
- Invoice Creation Form (autogenerated invoice number, validation, auto-calculated total)
- Invoice List View (table view, sorting/filtering, status display)
- Mark Invoice as Paid/Unpaid (visual indicator, status update)
- Client Management (add/edit/delete, associate with invoices)

### Secondary Core Objective (Completed)
- AI-Powered Query (LLM integration for natural language queries)

### Advanced Objectives (Completed)
- Overdue Handling (automatic detection, visual highlight)
- Authentication (admin login with JWT)
- Invoice PDF Export
- Responsive UI (Tailwind CSS)
- Dark Mode
- Email Invoice (SendGrip)
- Multi-Currency Support
- Dashboard with Metrics
- Export Data

### Not Implemented
- Import Data
- Recurring Invoices
- Payment Tracking
- User Roles and Permissions
- Audit Log (Activity Tracker)
- Invoice Templates

---

## Thought Process and Prioritization Strategy
- Prioritized backend API and data models to ensure a solid foundation.
- Implemented authentication and core business logic first.
- Built out frontend UI after backend endpoints were stable.
- Focused on must-have features before moving to advanced/bonus objectives.

---

## What I'd Do Next If Given More Time
- Improve and polish the UI/UX for a more seamless experience.
- Refactor and optimize backend code for maintainability.
- Add more advanced features (e.g., recurring invoices, payment tracking, audit log).
- Increase test coverage and add more robust error handling.

---

## Known Limitations or Bugs
- Some advanced features are not implemented (see above).
- UI could be further improved for usability and responsiveness.
- Error handling and validation could be more comprehensive in some areas.
- No audit log or user roles implemented.
- Recurring invoices and payment tracking are not available.
